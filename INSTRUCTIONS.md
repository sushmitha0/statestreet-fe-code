To get an understanding of your JavaScript and CSS skills we have provided you with designs for a fictional widget, and a JSON file to populate the widget with the correct data. Please do not hardcode the values from the designs.

We are not looking for pixel perfect, but we are interested in good development practices. Feel free to add additional features to the design.

With your submission, please include a README.md with clear instructions how to run your project, and any information you feel may be relevant to your submission.

**Use whatever code patterns, frameworks and build tools that you believe will best demonstrate your skillset.**
